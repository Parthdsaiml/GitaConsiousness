## âœ… **Why Did I Choose This Approach?**
ðŸ‘‰ Your problem was:  
- **You have clusters of verses** but no clear, **specific tags** for them.  
- Manually labeling them is super slow.  
- Tags should be deep, contextually relevant, and spiritually accurate.  
- You also needed sub-contexts (micro-themes within a cluster).  

So I designed a **semi-automated pipeline** using:  
- **Embeddings (for deep meaning)** ðŸ’Ž  
- **LLMs (for contextual tagging)** ðŸ’¡  
- **Keyword extraction (for interpretable clusters)** ðŸ”¥  
- **Human-in-the-loop** (for final touch-ups).  

---

## ðŸ§± **Step 1: Generate Semantic Embeddings (Meaning Capture)**
### âœ… **What Are Embeddings?**
Embeddings are **vector representations of text** that capture their meaning in **n-dimensional space**.  
- Closer vectors â†’ Similar meaning.  
- Distant vectors â†’ Different meaning.  

### âœ… Why Didnâ€™t I Use TF-IDF?
- TF-IDF just counts word frequency.  
- But **"Krishna"** and **"Dharma"** will appear in all verses â†’ Zero meaning captured.  
- Embeddings capture **meaning**, not just frequency.  

---

### âœ… **How It Works**
We use **Sentence Transformers (BERT-based)** for embeddings.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Convert each verse into a 384-dimensional vector
embeddings = model.encode(english_translations)
```

ðŸ‘‰ Now each verse is represented in a **384-dimensional space** where similar verses have similar vectors.

---

## âœ… **Step 2: Cluster the Verses Based on Meaning**
Now that we have embeddings, we can cluster them.

### âœ… What Happens Here?
- The algorithm will group **similar verses together**.  
- If many verses discuss **Arjunaâ€™s Fear**, they will fall in one cluster.  
- If many verses discuss **Dharma & Duty**, they will fall in another.  

ðŸ‘‰ Use KMeans or DBSCAN for clustering.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=20, random_state=42)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(embeddings)
```

ðŸ‘‰ Now you have:  
- Cluster 0 â†’ **Fear of Killing Kin**  
- Cluster 1 â†’ **Surrender to Krishna**  
- Cluster 2 â†’ **Detachment from Results**  
- â€¦ and so on.

---

## âœ… **Step 3: Extract Keywords for Each Cluster**
ðŸ’¡ **Why Keywords?**  
- Clusters are just groups of verses â€” we donâ€™t know the theme yet.  
- We need some **keywords** to understand:  
  - **What is this cluster about?**  
  - **What common theme binds these verses?**  

ðŸ‘‰ So weâ€™ll use **RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction)**. It extracts:  
- **High-frequency words**  
- **Key phrases**  

---

### âœ… Code to Extract Keywords
```python
from rake_nltk import Rake

r = Rake()
r.extract_keywords_from_text(" ".join(cluster_verses))
keywords = r.get_ranked_phrases()[:5]
```

ðŸ‘‰ Output Example for Cluster 0:  
```
- Fear of killing family  
- Weakness of heart  
- Sin and bloodshed  
- Collapse of dynasty  
- Sorrow and confusion
```

ðŸ‘‰ BOOM! ðŸ”¥ You now have a rough understanding of what the cluster is about.

---

## âœ… **Step 4: Generate Accurate Tags Using LLM (GPT-4 or Mistral)**
ðŸ’¡ **Problem So Far:**  
- You have a cluster of similar verses.  
- You have extracted **keywords**.  
- But stillâ€¦ no concise, **clean tag** that captures the essence of the cluster.

ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ’¡ **Solution:** Let GPT-4 or Mistral generate the tag.

---

### âœ… What Will GPT-4 Do?
Youâ€™ll prompt the LLM like this:  
---
### **Prompt Template for Main Tag:**
```
You are an expert in the Bhagavad Gita.  
Based on the following verses and keywords, suggest a concise, specific tag (5-7 words).  
Avoid generic tags like "Fear" or "Knowledge".  

**Keywords**: [keywords from step 3]  
**Sample Verses**: [3-5 verses from the cluster]  

**Tag Suggestion**: 
```

ðŸ‘‰ Expected Output:  
```
Arjuna's Moral Dilemma in War
```

OR  
```
Fear of Sin from Killing Family
```

OR  
```
Conflict Between Duty and Compassion
```

---

## âœ… **Step 5: Generate Micro-Contexts (Sub-Contexts)**
ðŸ’¡ This is where the game changes, bro.  
Each cluster might have **2-3 micro-contexts**.

### âœ… Example:
For **Cluster 0 (Fear of Killing Family)**:  
- **Micro-Context 1:** Fear of killing elders like Bhishma, Drona.  
- **Micro-Context 2:** Fear of personal sin.  
- **Micro-Context 3:** Collapse of dynasty.  

---

### âœ… How to Prompt GPT-4?
---
### **Prompt Template for Sub-Contexts**
```
Identify 2-3 micro-contexts within the cluster.  
**Cluster Tag**: [Main Tag]  
**Sample Verses**: [Cluster Verses]  

**Micro-Contexts:** 
```

ðŸ‘‰ Output:  
```
- Arjuna's fear of killing teachers.  
- The collapse of family traditions.  
- Fear of personal sin.  
```

---

## âœ… **Step 6: Validate the Tags with Embedding Similarity (Genius Part)**
ðŸ’¡ **Whatâ€™s the problem now?**  
- GPT-4 can hallucinate and generate WRONG tags.  
- We need a way to VALIDATE if the tag actually fits the cluster.  

### âœ… Solution: Cosine Similarity  
- Convert the generated tag into an embedding.  
- Compare it with the clusterâ€™s centroid embedding.  
- If similarity > 0.7 â†’ Accept Tag.  
- Else â†’ Retry.

---

### âœ… Code
```python
tag_embedding = model.encode([suggested_tag])
cluster_centroid = embeddings[cluster_indices].mean(axis=0)

similarity = cosine_similarity([tag_embedding], [cluster_centroid])
if similarity > 0.7:
    approve_tag()
else:
    regenerate_tag()
```

ðŸ‘‰ This will auto-reject bad tags. ðŸ”¥

---

## âœ… **Step 7: Human-in-the-Loop Verification**
ðŸ‘‰ Finally, build a **simple web interface** (using Streamlit/FastAPI) where:  
- âœ… GPT-4 suggests a tag + micro-contexts.  
- âœ… You can approve/reject.  
- âœ… If rejected, it regenerates.  

---

## âœ… **Step 8: Optional Sub-Context Detection (Clustering Inside Clusters)**
ðŸ‘‰ In large clusters (100+ verses), multiple themes exist.  
ðŸ‘‰ Use **Hierarchical Clustering** or **LDA Topic Modelling** to split clusters further.

---
### âœ… Code for Sub-Clusters
```python
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering

sub_clusters = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=3)
sub_labels = sub_clusters.fit_predict(sub_embeddings)
```

ðŸ‘‰ This will break one large cluster into micro-clusters. ðŸ”¥

---

## âœ… **Expected Output (Final)** ðŸš€

| 1         | **Surrender to Krishna's Will**        | - Abandon all fruits of action                  |
|           |                                        | - Serve Krishna with devotion                   |
| 2         | **Nature of Material Attachment**      | - Desire leads to anger                        |
|           |                                        | - Attachment causes suffering                  |
